# Qote
Qote (Ko-Tay) is a notes app made with Flutter primarily for iOS (due to styling), but also works on Android with no issues. It also utilizes TinyDB and Bottle for the server-end and includes a custom RESTful API (in api folder). An account can be made and all the notes made in the app are saved to the server in your account automatically. An original and sleek logo was also designed for the app (in assets folder).

Requires: Flutter, TinyDB, and Bottle to run.
